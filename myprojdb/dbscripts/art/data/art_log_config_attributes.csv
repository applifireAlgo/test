Once the configuration is refreshed new Log Events will be written to the configured Target (File, DB etc). This will help to isolate and troubleshoot a production environment without shutting down the application. #appfire#Refresh Frequency#appfire#1#appfire#\N#appfire#2015-10-21 18:11:01#appfire#\N#appfire#2015-10-21 18:11:01#appfire#1
